== OVERVIEW

This is a patched version of the OCaml compiler and runtime. It
provides a mechanism to statistically profile the heap.

== INSTALLATION

There is a opam switch packaging a port of this patch on OCaml
4.03. You can use:


     $ opam switch install 4.03.0+statistical-memprof

You may also compile this patched version. You have to activate the
profiler with:

     ./configure --statmemprof

== QUICK TEST ON YOUR PROJECT

See the opam package statmemprof-emacs

== Tuning

If you want more involved sampling schemes, you could
patch/reimplement statmemprof-emacs. Please refer to the documentation
of the Gc.Memprof stdlib module (only in this patched version of OCaml).

== Overview

OCaml is an implementation of the ML language, based on the Caml Light
dialect extended with a complete class-based object system and a powerful
module system in the style of Standard ML.

OCaml comprises two compilers. One generates bytecode which is then
interpreted by a C program. This compiler runs quickly, generates compact
code with moderate memory requirements, and is portable to essentially any
32 or 64 bit Unix platform. Performance of generated programs is quite good
for a bytecoded implementation.  This compiler can be used either as a
standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces standalone programs, or as
an interactive, toplevel-based system.

The other compiler generates high-performance native code for a number of
processors. Compilation takes longer and generates bigger code, but the
generated programs deliver excellent performance, while retaining the
moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler. The native-code
compiler currently runs on the following platforms:

|====
|                |  Tier 1 (actively maintained)   | Tier 2 (maintained when possible)

| x86 64 bits    | Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD  |  NetBSD, OpenBSD
| x86 32 bits    | Linux, Windows                  |  FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
| ARM 64 bits    | Linux                           |  FreeBSD
| ARM 32 bits    | Linux                           |  FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
| Power 64 bits  | Linux                           |
| Power 32 bits  |                                 |  Linux
| IBM Z (s390x)  | Linux                           |
|====

Other operating systems for the processors above have not been tested, but
the compiler may work under other operating systems with little work.

There also exist other mailing lists, chat channels, and various other forums
around the internet for getting in touch with the OCaml and ML family language
community. These can be accessed at

In particular, the IRC channel `#ocaml` on https://freenode.net/[Freenode] has a
long history and welcomes questions.

== Bug Reports and User Feedback

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues

To be effective, bug reports should include a complete program (preferably
small) that exhibits the unexpected behavior, and the configuration you are
using (machine type, etc).
