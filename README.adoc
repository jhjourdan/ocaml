== OVERVIEW

This is a patched version of the OCaml compiler and runtime. It
provides a mechanism to statistically profile the heap.

== INSTALLATION

There is a opam switch packaging a port of this patch on OCaml
4.03. You can use:


     $ opam switch install 4.03.0+statistical-memprof

You may also compile this patched version. You have to activate the
profiler with:

     ./configure --statmemprof

== QUICK TEST ON YOUR PROJECT

1- Copy the memprofHelpers.ml file in your project

2- Execute the following somewhere in your code:

     MemprofHelpers.start 1E-4 20 100

3- Execute your program. When you want a profile of the heap, just
send it the SIGUSR1 signal.

This will create a memory_profile file in the current directory,
containing the current profile of the heap. The file contains, in the
second column, the reverse call stacks at the allocation of the
sampled blocks, and, on the first column, the number of corresponding
samples. The row is masked if it corresponds to less than 100 samples.

A bit more information about the parameters of this function:

- 1st parameter (1E-4) : the sampling rate. Reasonnable values range
  from 1E-6 to 1E-2. Lower means less precision but less
  overhead. Higher means better precision (i.e., more samples) but
  more runtime overhead.

- 2nd parameter (20) : size of the callstack being dumped at each
  sample.

- 3rd parameter (100) : threshold below which nothing is printed in
  the output file.

== Tuning

If you want more involved sampling schemes, you could
patch/reimplement memprofHelpers.ml. Please refer to the documentation
of the Memprof stdlib module (only in this patched version of OCaml).

== Overview

OCaml is an implementation of the ML language, based on the Caml Light
dialect extended with a complete class-based object system and a powerful
module system in the style of Standard ML.

OCaml comprises two compilers. One generates bytecode which is then
interpreted by a C program. This compiler runs quickly, generates compact
code with moderate memory requirements, and is portable to essentially any
32 or 64 bit Unix platform. Performance of generated programs is quite good
for a bytecoded implementation.  This compiler can be used either as a
standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces standalone programs, or as
an interactive, toplevel-based system.

The other compiler generates high-performance native code for a number of
processors. Compilation takes longer and generates bigger code, but the
generated programs deliver excellent performance, while retaining the
moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler. The native-code
compiler currently runs on the following platforms:

Tier 1 (actively used and maintained by the core OCaml team):

AMD64 (Opteron)::    Linux, OS X, MS Windows
IA32 (Pentium)::     Linux, FreeBSD, OS X, MS Windows
PowerPC::            Linux, OS X
ARM::                Linux

Tier 2 (maintained when possible, with help from users):

AMD64::              FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD
IA32 (Pentium)::     NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris 9
PowerPC::            NetBSD
ARM::                NetBSD
SPARC::              Solaris, Linux, NetBSD

Other operating systems for the processors above have not been tested, but
the compiler may work under other operating systems with little work.

Before the introduction of objects, OCaml was known as Caml Special Light.
OCaml is almost upwards compatible with Caml Special Light, except for a few
additional reserved keywords that have forced some renaming of standard
library functions.

== Documentation

The OCaml manual is distributed in HTML, PDF, Postscript, DVI, and Emacs
Info files.  It is available at

http://caml.inria.fr/

The community also maintains the Web site http://ocaml.org, with tutorials
and other useful information for OCaml users.

== Availability

== Keeping in Touch with the Caml Community

There exists a mailing list of users of the OCaml implementations developed
at INRIA. The purpose of this list is to share experience, exchange ideas
(and even code), and report on applications of the OCaml language. Messages
can be written in English or in French. The list has more than 1000
subscribers.

Messages to the list should be sent to:

mailto:caml-list@inria.fr[]

You can subscribe to this list via the Web interface at

https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/subscribe/caml-list

Archives of the list are available on the Web site above.

The Usenet news `groups comp.lang.ml` and `comp.lang.functional` also
contains discussions about the ML family of programming languages, including
OCaml.

The IRC channel `#ocaml` on https://freenode.net/[Freenode] also has several
hundred users and welcomes questions.

The OCaml Community website is

== Bug Reports and User Feedback

Please report bugs using the Web interface to the bug-tracking system at
http://caml.inria.fr/bin/caml-bugs

To be effective, bug reports should include a complete program (preferably
small) that exhibits the unexpected behavior, and the configuration you are
using (machine type, etc).

You can also contact the implementors directly at mailto:caml@inria.fr[].
