(** [Memprof] is an sampling engine for allocated words. The blocks

    are sampled according to a Poisson process. That is, every block
    has a probability of being sampled which is proportional to its
    size, and large blocks can be sampled several times. The samples
    appear using a configurable sampling rate.

    This engine is typically used by a statistical memory profiler.

      but the callback call has been postponed because the allocation
      took place in a context where calling an arbitrary code was not
      possible.

(** [callback] is the type of callbacks launch by the sampling
    engine. Its parameters are, in order:
      - The kind of the allocation.
      - The size of the allocated block, in words (exclusing the
        header).
      - The number of samples in this block. Always > 1, it is sampled
        according to a Poisosn process, and in average equal to the
        size of the block (including the header) multiplied by
        lambda (the sampling rate).
      - The callstack for the allocation.
   A callback returns an option over an ephemeron whose key is set
   to the allocated block for further tracking.

   The sampling is temporarily disabled when calling the callback. So
   it need not be reentrant.

   Note that when the callback kind is [Major_postponed], the callback
   needed to be postponed after the actual allocation. Therefore, the
   context of the callback is maybe slightly different than
   expected. This should happen very rarely if no C binding is
   used. *)
